# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Essential Commands

### Building and Testing

```bash
# Run all tests (primary development command)
bazel test //...

# Run specific test suites
bazel test //flutter/tests:all_tests          # Unit/toolchain tests in main workspace
cd e2e/smoke && bazel test //:integration_tests  # Integration tests (external workspace)
bazel test //flutter/tests:versions_test       # Unit tests for versions

# Build specific targets
bazel build //:update_flutter_versions        # Build update script target
cd e2e/smoke && bazel build //flutter_app:hello_world_app

# Update Flutter SDK versions with real integrity hashes
bazel run //tools:update_flutter_versions
# Or run directly: ./scripts/update_flutter_versions.sh
```

### End-to-End Integration Testing

The `e2e/` directory contains separate Bazel projects that test rules_flutter end-to-end as external consumers would use it.

**IMPORTANT**: Always `cd` into the e2e subdirectory before running integration tests:

```bash
# Navigate to e2e directory for integration testing
cd e2e/smoke

# Run integration tests from within e2e directory
bazel test //:integration_tests               # Integration test suite
bazel test //...                              # All integration tests
bazel build //...                             # All integration targets
# Example app targets are defined per e2e workspace package

# Test pub.dev dependency integration
bazel test //:pub_integration_test            # Test pub package usage
bazel build //:flutter_app_with_deps          # Build app with dependencies

# Return to root for main development
cd ../..
```

**Integration Test Structure**:

- Each `e2e/` subdirectory is a standalone Bazel workspace
- Uses `local_repository` to reference the rules_flutter under development
- Tests real-world usage scenarios as external consumers would experience
- Validates the public API and user experience

### Code Quality

```bash
# Format Starlark files (required before commits)
bazel run @buildifier_prebuilt//:buildifier

# Update generated BUILD file targets
bazel run //:gazelle

# Install pre-commit hooks (recommended for development)
pre-commit install

# Run all pre-commit hooks manually (required before completing tasks)
pre-commit run --all-files --verbose
```

### Task Completion Requirements

**CRITICAL**: Before completing any task, you MUST run the following commands and fix any problems:

```bash
# 1. Run all pre-commit hooks and fix any issues
pre-commit run --all-files --verbose

# 2. Run all tests to ensure nothing is broken
bazel test //...

# 3. Run buildifier to ensure code formatting
bazel run @buildifier_prebuilt//:buildifier

# 4. Update BUILD targets if needed
bazel run //:gazelle
```

If any of these commands fail, you MUST fix the issues before considering the task complete. This ensures code quality and prevents breaking changes from being introduced.

### Development Setup

```bash
# Override rules_flutter to use local development version
OVERRIDE="--override_repository=rules_flutter=$(pwd)/rules_flutter"
echo "common $OVERRIDE" >> ~/.bazelrc
```

## Architecture Overview

### Core Structure

**rules_flutter** is a Bazel ruleset for building Flutter applications. The current implementation is in **Phase 1** with placeholder rules that validate toolchain resolution but don't perform actual Flutter builds yet.

### Key Components

1. **Flutter SDK Management** (`flutter/repositories.bzl`, `flutter/private/versions.bzl`)

   - Downloads Flutter SDK from Google Cloud Storage with integrity verification
   - Supports versions 3.24.0, 3.27.0, 3.29.0 across macOS/Linux/Windows
   - Real SHA-256 hashes fetched from Flutter's official release APIs

2. **Toolchain System** (`flutter/toolchain.bzl`, `flutter/private/toolchains_repo.bzl`)

   - `FlutterInfo` provider exposes `target_tool_path` and `tool_files`
   - Multi-platform toolchain registration via `flutter_register_toolchains()`
   - Platform mapping handled in `PLATFORMS` constant

3. **Build Rules** (`flutter/defs.bzl`)

   - `flutter_library`: Assembles dependency caches (no `pub get`) and shares outputs with dependents
   - `flutter_app`: Uses `flutter_library` workspaces and pub caches to build targets (web, apk, ios, macos, linux, windows)
   - `flutter_test`: Launches `flutter test` using the prepared workspace from `flutter_library`
   - `dart_library`: Pass-through rule for Dart source files
   - Rules resolve the Flutter toolchain and perform real command invocations

4. **Version Management** (`scripts/update_flutter_versions.sh`)
   - Automated script fetching from `storage.googleapis.com/flutter_infra_release/releases/`
   - Converts Flutter's SHA-256 hashes to SRI format for Bazel integrity checking
   - Updates `flutter/private/versions.bzl` with current release data

### Test Organization

- **Unit tests**: `flutter/tests/versions_test.bzl` - validates version dictionary structure and internal logic
- **Toolchain tests**: `flutter/tests/toolchain/` - Dart library and toolchain validation smoke tests
- **Integration tests**: `e2e/smoke/` - standalone Bazel workspace testing rules_flutter as external users would consume it
  - **CRITICAL**: Always `cd e2e/smoke` before running e2e tests
  - Tests complete workflows: Flutter app creation, pub dependencies, multi-platform builds
  - Validates public API usability and real-world scenarios

### Important Implementation Details

- **Enhanced Implementation Status**: Flutter rules now properly resolve toolchains, validate project structure, and create structured outputs demonstrating real build readiness
- **Integrity Checking**: Enabled with real SHA-256 hashes from Flutter's official APIs
- **Toolchain Resolution**: Rules properly resolve toolchains and validate Flutter SDK access
- **Provider Fields**: Use `flutter_toolchain.flutterinfo.target_tool_path` (not `target_tool`)
- **Build Validation**: All rules validate pubspec.yaml presence, organize Dart files properly, and demonstrate platform-specific targeting

### Development Workflow

The project follows conventional commit messages for automated releases. Development priorities:

1. **✅ COMPLETED**: Enhanced Flutter rules with toolchain validation and structured outputs
2. Implement actual Flutter command execution (offline dependency prep, `flutter build`, `flutter test`)
3. Add pub dependency resolution and caching
4. Implement platform-specific build capabilities
5. Add hot reload support and development workflow improvements

### Extension Points

- Add new Flutter versions in `scripts/update_flutter_versions.sh` SUPPORTED_VERSIONS array
- Platform support defined in `flutter/private/toolchains_repo.bzl` PLATFORMS
- Build targets configured by `flutter_app` macro platform attributes
